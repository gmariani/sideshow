# SideShow
SideShow is an AIR based FLV player. Based on [TempoLite](https://mariani.life/projects/tempolite), it's capable of playing FLVs, MP4s, or really whatever Flash Player is capable of. SideShow currently supports the following file types: flv, mp4, m4v, m4a, 3gp, mov, f4v, f4p, f4a, f4b, mp3. The UI is based on Sasami2K, a fantastic video player built years and years ago. Sasami2K is no longer actively developed (latest was in 2001) so I took it upon myself to revive my own version in the form of SideShow. The majority of the UI is only in the context menu.
